# Refine All: Cross-Epic Spec Refinement

## Inputs

- **All specs** — discover by globbing `specs/[0-9][0-9]-*.md` (exclude `*-brainstorming.md`)
- **PRD** — read `expliq_prd.md`
- **Tech stack** — read `tech-stack-idea.md`
- **Results from completed epics** — glob `specs/*-results.md`. These contain actual versions installed, deviations from specs, and risks flagged for future epics.

Do NOT read `specs/brainstorming.md` — its decisions are already incorporated into each spec.

## Phase 1 — Cross-Epic Analysis & Apply

Read every spec in order. Build a mental model of:

1. **Data flow** — which epic produces each piece of data, which epics consume it
2. **Schema dependencies** — fields, types, and enums that are referenced across epics
3. **Assumption chains** — where one epic assumes something that another epic defines (or fails to define)

Then perform these checks across ALL specs:

### Cross-epic checks

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Forward dependency gaps** | Epic N references something that no earlier epic establishes |
| **Backward impact** | A decision in epic N invalidates or changes requirements in an earlier epic |
| **Schema drift** | Field names, types, or enums used inconsistently across specs |
| **Duplicated scope** | Work that appears in multiple epics without clear ownership |
| **Missing handoff** | Epic N's output doesn't match what epic N+1 expects as input |
| **Acceptance criteria gaps** | ACs that can't be verified because a dependency isn't met yet |
| **Implementation drift** | Spec assumes patterns, versions, or APIs that differ from what was actually built in completed epics (per results files) |

### Within-epic checks (same as `/refine`)

- Ungrounded assumptions
- Hidden scope creep
- Oversized slices
- Missing or untestable acceptance criteria
- Inconsistent domain language

### Applying changes

1. Determine the **change order** — if epic 01 and epic 04 both need changes, and epic 04's changes affect epic 01, apply epic 01 changes first
2. **Structural fixes** — apply directly to spec files. Retain the original section structure (Scope, Acceptance criteria, Out of scope, Domain terms, Open questions).
3. **Design decisions** — do NOT apply. Instead, add as an open question on the spec tagged `NEEDS CONFIRMATION`. Also collect these in the review file for Phase 2.
4. Remove resolved open questions; add new ones surfaced during review.

### Cascade handling

If a fix to epic N requires a change to epic M (where M < N):

- Apply the change to epic M as well
- Document the cascade in the review report

### Output

Write `specs/cross-epic-review.md` with all findings and changes:

```markdown
# Cross-Epic Review — {date}

## Summary
- Total specs reviewed: N
- Specs modified: list
- Specs clean: list

## Changes by Epic

### {epic number} — {epic name}
- **Issue**: description (check type tag)
  - **Involved epics**: which others are affected
  - **Change**: what was modified in the spec
  - **Cascade**: if this caused changes elsewhere, note them
  - Or: `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` — added as open question

(repeat for each issue)

### {next epic}
...

## Cascading Changes
List any chains where a fix in one epic triggered fixes in others.
```

### Post Phase 1

In chat, give a concise summary: how many specs reviewed, how many modified, most significant findings.

- If there are **no** `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` items → skip Phase 2, tell the user the specs are ready for implementation
- If there **are** `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` items → tell the user that questions are ready in `specs/cross-epic-review.md` and proceed to Phase 2

## Phase 2 — Brainstorming

Only runs if Phase 1 produced `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` items.

Conduct all brainstorming exclusively in `specs/cross-epic-review.md`.

### Expected results

- A `## Brainstorming` section is appended to `specs/cross-epic-review.md` with grouped, focused questions covering all `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` items
- Questions are grouped by epic, with enough context for the user to decide
- The user's answers are captured in the same file
- Follow-up questions are appended based on answers until all items are resolved

### Rules

- The file is **append-only** — never overwrite or remove existing content
- All questions go into the file, never in chat
- Chat is only for telling the user that questions are ready or that a phase is complete
- Finish brainstorming completely before moving to Phase 3

## Phase 3 — Apply Confirmations

For each resolved `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` item:

1. Apply the confirmed decision to the spec file (update scope, ACs, or remove the open question as appropriate)
2. Remove the `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` tag from the spec's open questions
3. Append a `## Confirmations Applied` section to `specs/cross-epic-review.md` listing what was resolved and how

In chat, give a concise summary. The specs are now ready for implementation.

## Constraints

- **Do not implement anything.** No code, no configuration, no project setup. Output is only markdown files.
- **Do not invent requirements.** Everything must trace back to a spec, the PRD, or explicit user confirmation.
- **Do not re-review already-refined content.** If a brainstorming file has a `## Refinement Applied` section, those changes are settled — only review the current state of the spec.
- **Judgment calls require confirmation.** If a fix involves a design decision (not just a structural correction), flag it as `NEEDS CONFIRMATION` and add it as an open question on the spec — do not apply it.
